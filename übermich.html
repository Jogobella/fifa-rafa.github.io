            <h1>HelloðŸ˜Š</h1>

            <h2>My name is Katarzyna Brzeski.I live in WÃ¼rzburg. I am a third-year student studying computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence and data science at the Academy of Economics and Humanities in Warsaw. There are still four semesters until I get my bachelor's degree in engineering.

                I am currently completing my fourth semester, in which I took introductory courses on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design and achieved very positive results. During the first two years of my studies, I built a solid theoretical and practical foundation in various areas of computer science, including programming and algorithms.
                
                Starting next semester, I will take special courses in artificial intelligence and data science. These courses allow me to explore advanced methods of data analysis, machine learning and intelligent system design. At the same time, my passion for project management and user experience led me to focus on these areas. I believe that understanding user needs and the ability to manage project teams are crucial to developing innovative and user-friendly technologies.
                
                Last semester I enthusiastically took on my first challenges in the areas of UX and UI. Through these experiences, I learned to design intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces that meet users' needs. I worked on various projects where I was able to apply my knowledge in practice.
                
                The pursuit of harmony between technology and human needs drives my actions and motivates me to continue to grow. I am confident that in the future I can make a significant contribution to the development of innovative projects that not only meet technical requirements but also provide unforgettable user experiences.
